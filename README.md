Electrostatics in a cylinder with variable dielectric and free charges. 
This exercise aims to study the equation governing the electric potential in electrostatics,
which is a second order spatially dependent partial differential equation. This problem will 
be treated using the finite element method, to transform it into a variational form, 
which will then be discretized, using Galerkin’s method, leading to a linear algebraic system.
Numerically, the points of interest will be the prioritization of different spatial intervals, as
well as the study of numerical errors which occur due to physical discontinuities. Physically,
a focus will be given to the study of the electric potential that ensues from a given charge
distribution, as well as the discontinuities that result from a change in electric permitivitty. A
verification of Gauss’ law will be undertaken and the bound charges in a given configuration
will be found, both analytically and numerically.
